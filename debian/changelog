ros-bouncy-launch (0.5.1-0bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Changed the behavior when signaling SIGINT to subprocesses on Windows, where it now does SIGTERM instead, because SIGINT causes a ValueError about SIGINT being an unsupported signal number. (#94 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/94>)
  * Fixed a bug by avoiding reentrancy in the SIGINT signal handler. (#92 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/92>)
  * Various Windows fixes. (#87 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/87>)
    * LaunchService.run() now returns non-0 when there are exceptions in coroutines.
    * Updated ``launch_counters.py`` example for Windows.
    * Fixed a bug that would cause mismatched asyncio loops in some futures.
    * Addressed the fact that ``signal.SIGKILL`` doesnâ€™t exist on Windows, so emulate it in our Event.
    * Fixed an issue that resulted in spurious asyncio errors in LaunchService test.

ros-bouncy-launch (0.5.0-0bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Fixed a bug where unclosed asyncio loops caused a traceback on the terminal on exit, but only in Python 3.5 (#85 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/85>)
  * Changed to use variable typing in comments to support python 3.5 (#81 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/81>)
  * New launch API (#74 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/74>)
    * See pull request for more details and links to architecture documentation and the design doc.
  * Moved launch source files into launch.legacy namespace (#73 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/73>)
    * This was in preparation for the new launch API.
  * [for launch.legacy] fixed a flake8 warning (#72 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/72>)
  * [for launch.legacy] set zip_safe to avoid warning during installation (#71 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/71>)
  * [for launch.legacy] Fix hang on keyboard interrupt (#69 <https://github.com/ros2/launch/issues/69>)
    * When keyboard interrupt exception occurs loop.run_forever is called. But there is no loop.stop call. This causes a hang.
